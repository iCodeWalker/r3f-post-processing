# Multi-Sampling

    Multi sampling is used to prevent the aliasing effect (the stairs effect on the geometry).
    By default its value is at 8 and we can lower it down to 0 in order to disable it completely with the multisampling attribute.

# Finding effects and how to implement them

    Should go through the documentation in order to discover the various effects, test them and see the results of the effects.

# Vignette Effect

    This will make the corner of the render darker.
